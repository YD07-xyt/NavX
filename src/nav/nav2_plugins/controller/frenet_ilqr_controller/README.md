# Overview

This is local trajectory planner that generates trajectories using the method in paper named [Optimal Trajectory Generation for Dynamic Street Scenarios in a Frenet Frame](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5509799) and tracks this generated trajectory using Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Method.

In its structure, it has some policy implementations such as `ObstaclePolicy`, which eliminates unfeasible trajectories right before selecting best trajectory, 
and cost implementations such as Lateral Distance Cost Checker and Longtitutal Velocity Cost Checker, 
which is used for selecting best trajectory to be given for Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Trajectory Tracker to find optimal inputs. This local planner consists of 2 modules, which is `ilqr_trajectory_tracker`, `frenet_trajectory_planner`.

For trajectory generation phase, `frenet_trajectory_planner` is used for generating optimal trajectory. This trajectory generation is done by planning longtitutal velocity and lateral distance separately. 
For longtitutal velocity planning, Quartic Polynomial Trajectory Planning generates some velocity trajectory plans in Frenet frame, which the user also can set how many velocity plan can be produced.
For lateral distance planning, Quintic Polynomial Trajectory Planning generates some lateral distance plans in Frenet Frame, which the user also can set how many lateral distance plan can be produced. 

Then using cartesian product of two set, one of them is the set of lateral distance plans and other one is the set of longtitutal velocity plans, trajectory in Frenet frame, which gives where robot is in type of arclength of line and the distance from curve in that point, is produced and 
this trajectory in Frenet frame can be converted to cartesian trajectory, which consists of x, y cartesian points and its first and second derivatives, later. After generating all trajectories, the best frenet trajectory inside these trajectories is selected using `policies` and `costcheckers` and converted to Cartesian trajectory.
Finally this generated best trajectory is tracked by Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator.

# How to run

Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CihatAltiparmak/frenet_ilqr_controller.git -b humble
```

Build dockerfile by going to the directory of cloned repository.
```sh
cd frenet_ilqr_controller
docker build -t frenet_ilqr_controller_demo .
```

Run below command not to fail gui works.
```sh
xhost +
```

Open two terminals and start gazebo simulation from the first terminal like below and navigation2 from the second terminal. (you should continue from turtlebot3_navigation2 package because of navigation2's turtlebot3 sdf file is outdated and causes odom not handling cmd_vel commands well, who knows, maybe this repo's bug or navigation2's bug :/)
```sh
docker run -it --gpus=all -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all --runtime=nvidia --rm --net=host --name frenet_ilqr_controller_demo --privileged --volume="${XAUTHORITY}:/root/.Xauthority" --env="DISPLAY=$DISPLAY" -v="/tmp/.gazebo/:/root/.gazebo/" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw --shm-size=1000mb ros-navigation/nav2_docker:humble
(inside docker) source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
(inside docker) source install/setup.bash
(inside docker) ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

```sh

#### Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator

| Parameter                  | Type         | Definition                                                                              |

For instance, the first coefficient of this array can be increased in order to make optimizer focus on errors in x axis much more while trying to minimize the cost function. For those who understands how iterative quadratic regulator works, it's just a matter of setting Q matrix. In this parameter table, this array stands for the error in x axis(m), the error in y axis(m), the error at yaw angle(rad) and the error at velocity(m/s^2) respectively|
| r_coefficients             | double array | Default: [0.2, 0.2]. The coefficients to penalize the unnecessary usage of input values. For instance, the first coefficient of this array can be increased in order to make optimizer focus on using as less acceleration as possible while trying to minimize the cost function. This functionality is useful when the resources used for inputs are much more important then being stable. For those who understands how iterative quadratic regulator works, it's just a matter of setting R matrix. In this parameter table, this array stands for acceleration in m/s^2 and angular velocity rad/s |
